# Exercise 1.35

> Show that the golden ratio $\phi$ (section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the transformation $x \mapsto 1 + \dfrac{1}{x}$.

Since $\phi$ satisfies the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2}-x-1&=0 \\
x^{2}&=x+1 \\
x&=1+\dfrac{1}{x},
\end{aligned}
$$

by letting $f\left( x\right)$ be $1+\dfrac{1}{x}$,

$$x=f\left( x\right) ,$$

it is obvious that $x=\phi$ is a fixed point of the transformation $x \mapsto 1 + \dfrac{1}{x}$.
