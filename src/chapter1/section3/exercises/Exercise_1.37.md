# Exercise 1.37

> How large must you make `k` in order to get an ap­proximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?

12.

## Analysis

$$\dfrac{1}{\phi} = 0.6180 \textnormal{ (4 d.p.)}$$

When `k` is 11, `cont-frac` evaluates to 0.6180555555555556.

When `k` is 12, `cont-frac` evaluates to 0.6180257510729613.

## Conclusion

Thus, the minimum `k` to achieve an ap­proximation accurate to 4 decimal places is 12.
