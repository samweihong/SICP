# Exercise 2.8

> Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa's, describe how the difference of two inÂ­tervals may be computed.

Since $a - b$ is smaller when $a$ is smaller and/or $b$ is larger, $a - b$ is minimum when $a$ is minimum and $b$ is maximum.

Thus, the minimum value of the difference of two intervals is the difference of the minuend's lower bound and subtrahend's upper bound.

Similarly, since $a - b$ is larger when $a$ is larger and/or $b$ is smaller, $a - b$ is maximum when $a$ is maximum and $b$ is minimum.

Thus, the maximum value of the difference of two intervals is the difference of the minuend's upper bound and subtrahend's lower bound.
